When we start out learning how to code, we're clearly ignorrent of the magnitude of the task we're about to undertake. Still, stary eyed and full of hope we embark on what will be the most challenging and equally rewarding mission of our lives. There will be times when you get stuck and feel hopeless. There will be other times you overcome a problem and feel a happiness and pride I imagine a parent feels for their child. For your code is the product of who you are. It is your baby. Like a child whom you watch grow, there are times you feel pride and times you will feel disappointment, and as such, your sense of responsiblity will reward you with confidence at times, and afflict you with guilt or shame at others. Being a developer is both a gift and a curse. With each new bug you encounter, with each new developer whos code you read, you will be faced with a feeling on either side of that spectrum. What I can say without a doubt, is that as your experience grows, your self asteme becomes less volotile and the qualities which measure your ability become more tailored. I find comfort in that.
