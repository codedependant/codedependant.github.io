I've been lucky enough to work with some very talented engineers and designers.

<!-- For 7 years I worked at Internet Solutions, building large scale web applications that allowed corperate clients throughout Africa manage ICT infrastructure. -->

Currently I work at [Meyer Miller Smith](http://www.meyermillersmith.com/){:target="_blank"}, one of Europes' oldest and most awarded digital design studios, where we build beautifully crafted digital experiences ranging from [video platforms](http://zuio.tv/){:target="_blank"} for Axel Springer to HTML5 games for Redbull.
